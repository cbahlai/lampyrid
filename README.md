This repository contains the 2016 class project for Open Science and Reproducible Research (ENT 890), taught by Dr Chrisite Bahlai at Michigan State University. Within the repo we have our R code, figures and links to the citation managment software and collaborative writing format. 

Our aim was to do an analysis examining what factors (weather, dd accumulation, time and/or habitat) may affect lampyrid abundance in Southwest Michigan. Data were obtained from a publicly available dataset at http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/datatables. Lampyrid abundance was quantified using yellow sticky traps over time across various habitat treatments that have been established in Hickory Corners, MI at Kellogg Bioloigcal Station's Long Term Ecological Research Station since the late 1980's. 

We collaboratively came up with biological hypotheses, cleaned and formatted the dataset, analysed the data and wrote the manuscript.
